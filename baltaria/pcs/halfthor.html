<h2>Description</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>As a child <TBD> was very small and weak and was unable to pull his own weight. Due to this he was treated horribly by all the other members of the tribe, and was constantly threatened to be exiled from the tribe and left for dead. The only friend he had in the world was a goldfish named snuffles, and no matter what happened he could always count on snuffles to be there to make him feel better. One day the tribe came across a number of bodies that had recently been killed near an old cave at the top of a mountain. There was a mix of two different banners on the armor of the bodies indicating that there had been a fight between two groups, and the bodies of one of the groups looked like they had all been carefully searched for something. While <tbd> was looking around he saw a shimmer of light coming from the side of the mountain. Upon further inspection he saw that there was something hidden inside the rock. When he pulled the object out he  was unsure what the item was, but he could feel that it had a strong magical presence. He decided that because it looked pretty it would make a perfect decoration for snuffles bowl. <To be continued></p>
