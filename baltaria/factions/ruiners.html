<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ruiners are followers of the Sanguine Knight. They exist to follow the creature, and assist it in its goal of returning its weapon to full power. Beyond that their motivations are a mystery, as well as how they operate. It is unclear if they have existed secretly this entire time since The Sanguine Knights initial death, or if they popped up again immediately upon its Resurrection. The only faction the party has seen was disguised as the Baltarian Ruinilogical society, an archaeological group. The party had a close confrontation with them, but ultimately killed all of the members they met in battle.</p>

<p>It's unknown what any goals might be outside of what is listed, and if they even have the ability to take orders from the Sanguine Knight or they make their own agenda.</p>
