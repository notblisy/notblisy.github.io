<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Dr.Bolas was attempting to strike a deal with Reeve, the quirky Kobold who runs the Oozomancery. Reeve wasn't really in a haggling mood, but Dr.Bolas' new friend Gregory Bumble offers up a deal-- If he acts as a guinea pig for Reeves new untested potion, Bolas can get a weapon of ooze on the cheap. Soon after, Bolas has a dagger and Gregory can't feel their arm.


</p>



<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Kobald from Glimmer who runs a shop focused on turning Ooze remains into weapons. We met them as we walked into their shop.

</p>


<h2>Player Character Interaction</h2>
<p>Reeve was a really nice to the party but was not the haggling type. Only major interaction was Bumble taking the test potion. Also, if you ever bring Ooze back to Reeve he'll pay you a fair price for it. On top of that I think we have his business cards to spread the word about his shop.
