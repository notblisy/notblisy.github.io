<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Zinnea sighs and slumps in her throne. The last visitor for the day has just left. Exhausted, she says to her 
busband "That was an angry batch today my dear. It seems we have more work to do next week than I'd like, I'll 
assign cousin Cithrel to the work with the fishermen though, he seems to deal with them much better than I ever 
can." Ludan nods in agreement and says "On top of that, Katz has been acting up again recently. I don't know what 
we can do to help that poor girl, she seems so lost. She's 80 now, I hope we can figure something out for her soon, 
she's almost an adult. So I think delegation is best so we can try to spend some time with her." As they settle in 
for bed later that evening, a guard knocks on their bedroom door. "Yes, what is it?" Answers Zinnea. The guard 
nervously says "Dutchess, someone has abandoned a child right in front of the gates of your castle with a small 
note begging for help. The child was dropped right as the guard change occured, so we could not see or catch the 
culprate. We thought you should know what happened." Zinnea and Ludan rush to the front gates as the guards are 
just picking the child up to take to an orphanage. The moment the two of them saw the baby they were in love. 
"Don't. Leave her with us. The note said they needed help, right?" Said Ludan. The Dutchess and Duke walk back into 
the castle, newborn human in hand. </p>




<h2>Zinnea Herris</h2>
<p>Zinnea is the Dutchess of the city of Nïrva, Wife to Ludan Herris, and adoptive mother to Katz von Dunkelheit 
and Forebrand Seralore. She is the blood heir to the throne of this city, and her husband took her name when they 
married. Though he was also of royal descent. She is a tall, with fairly pale skin and jet black hair. Zinnea cares 
for her children first, above all else. She can be a strict mother, but on the inside she is a softy, and just 
wants the best for her kids. She didn't tolerate a lot of the trouble that Katz got into when she was younger, and 
felt lost about how to help her. Though does her best to be a fair and just ruler to her people. Her main duties to 
the city she prioritizes is taxation of the city and surrounding ward villages, handling a lot of the problems that 
arise because of the military, and handling huge tourism industry.</p>

<h2>Ludan Herris</h2>
<p>Ludan is the Duke of Nïrva, Husband of Zinnea Herris, and adoptive father of Katz von Dunkelheit and Forebrand 
Seralore. Ludan is a fairly short and sleight man, with short black hair. While his stature is small, he commands 
respect and is extremely intense. His booming voice helps in this endeavor, and he is an extremely attentive 
listener. When citizens are at the court to explain their greivances, they say it is almost as if he pierces their 
soul with how intense his stare is. Ludan is a stern father, but extremely supportive. When his youngest daughter 
wanted to join the guard, he did not think twice of it, and told the generals to treat her no different, and he 
meant it. When his oldest was struggling to find her place, he had no issue with her desire to go adventuring to 
find her place.</p>
<h2>Adoption</h2>
<p>While typically it might be rare for Elves to adopt and care for other races, especially royal Elves, the 
Herris' were particularly privy to the idea of adopting children who need their help because of the son they lost. 
The rulers had tried for many years to have a child, and continously failed to conveiced or had miscarraiges. The 
day they finally had their beautiful boy, they could not have been happier. Unfortunately, at the young age of 10 
their son while playing on the beach slipped and cracked his head on a rocky portion of the shore, and could not be 
saved. This devastated both Zinnea and Ludan, and for quite a while they did not even try to conceive. Then they 
day came, 95 years ago, an infant drow was left on their castle doorstep with a note that read but 3 words. Blessed 
by Corellon. The infant came to be known as Katz von Dunkelheit of house Herris. 80 years later, a similar 
situation occured, but with a note just saying Please. Help. Not hesitant one bit, the Herris' were prepared for 
their second daughter, this time a human, to join their family.
