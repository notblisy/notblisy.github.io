<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Ristal enters the scene without us even seeing him get there-- Somehow, his stealth and skill eluded all of our perceptions and he was just in the seat when we all blinked. Left a big first impression on us.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ristal is a smooth talkin and walkin Drow who slid into our team using his expert stealth. He appealed to us both because of his ability to gather intelligence, and since we have a few different people who we do not know the whereabouts of, we decided tracking was of importance to us. In addition, he had worked with ships a bit, so we thought he could aide us there in a pinch.</p>
