<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>The spirit of vengeance is a remnant of a memory of a man who once lived, who was slain by the Sanguine Knight. 


</p>



<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They are a spirit of vengeance, whose only purpose is to slay the Sanguine Knight and its followers.

</p>


<h2>Player Character Interaction</h2>
<p>The party met them as they walked into the center of greywater swamp, they told us that the followers of the knight were not in the swamp, and that the knight itself was in the shard. They seem to have some sort of automatically knowledge for its location.
