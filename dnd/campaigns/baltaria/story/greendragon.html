<h2>The story so far...</h2>

<p>
After defeating the Mummy in the desert town of sunstone, we head back to our guild hall where we meet up with our B team who have just defeated a dragon near Flamecrest. We receive our next mission which is to investigate strange noises in the woods outside of Nirva. After investigating the woods, we do not find much until we near the spot Regan formerly occupied. We hear the sounds of metal and glass.
</p>
<p>
Here we find a man with several strange creatures in combat with several otherworldly beings. After defeating the otherworldly beings the man tells us the metal and glass sound is the sound of reality tearing apart and we exhange information and move on.
