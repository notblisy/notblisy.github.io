<h2>The story so far...</h2>

<p>
After finshing our recruitment, we were offered three jobs via our bulliten board. Slaying a White Dragon, Slaying a Hydra, and Investigating a Pyramid that popped up overnight to the east of Sunstone about a week ago. The main team chose to visit the Pyramid, while the B team went to find the White Dragon. In addition, we sent Ristal on a mission to track down House Orien. 
</p>
<p>
Once we arrived in Sunstone, Whitemain said the Pyramid showed up out of nowhere, and now water and food turns to dust in their hands. Katz remembered that the Shard in the ruins south of Sunstone actually sat atop a sarcophagus, which we thought at the time was just a table. It must have been sealing this mummy away. With this information, Katz purchases Shiva the camel and we head towards the Pyramid, making it there without much issue.
</p>
<p>
Two figures guarding the pyramid, nervous they would be guardians or evil ect.
we engage in combat with the two guards. After entering the pyramid there is nothing but a straight line forward. After a few minutes of walking we enter the first chamber. It is fileld with Kruthiks. Big reptile/bug monsters. We defeat them.
We spend the night in a tiny hut to rest, then march forward into the chamber.  We walk down that hallway to a T intersection, and decide to turn right. There are 4 pots each sitting on a pressure plate in this hallway. Katz shoots every pot to reveal 20 coins in each pot. Then, she shoots the pile of coins off the plate of the closest one to prove it was trapped with darts in an attempt to dissuade Glanzend from picking them up. We then walk up to another door. Behind the door is a combat with several ghouls, scorpions, and ghosts.
