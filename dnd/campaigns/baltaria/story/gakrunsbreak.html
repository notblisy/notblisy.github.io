<h2>The story so far...</h2>

<p>
After setting up our guild hall provided to us by the Baltarian govt, we moved along with our contracted mission to depose the current leader of Bolas, along with their secret ally, Gakrun Break. Gakrun is one of the three bandit kings and a major nuisance to Baltaria in general. He commands a sizeable goblinoid army that consistently attacks the walled city of Bolas.
</p>
<p>
Upon reaching Bolas, we learned several things. Orchid, aka Dr.Corvatch Bolas, was nobility of this town at one point. But the current leader Jericho Cade assasinated Orchids father and framed Orchid, then Jericho took over the town. They then formed some sort of alliance with Gakrun to get a cease fire against Bolas, but it's all a veil for the power Gakrun is trying to attain. 
</p>
<p>
The town was very heavily guarded by great walls and numerous guards. There was also an extremely long line to get in, and the guards seemed to be very thorough in regards to their checking. To avoid this, we disguised Bolas, who would be recognized as a traitor to their city. 

Orchid then used some magic and their knowledge of Goblin tongue to fake the sounds of a Goblinoid army far in the distance, so the line was hurried in with limited checking. This let us keep all of our weapons and lessed the chance that Orchid got recognized, even through disguise magic.   
</p>
<p>
Once in the city, we learned that Jericho Cade was not there, and despite asking to expedite the process with money, we could do no such thing. In addition, we figured he was at Gakruns camp, but because of the thought that there could be a goblin army, the city was on lockdown and we could not leave. So, we abandoned our horses (GOODBYE ANIMA), and took a secret passage through the wall to head towards Gakruns camp.
</p>
<p>
On the way to Gakruns camp, we met up with a former member of the Cult of the Iron Gear named Creed, a Hob Goblin who once controlled Gakruns current army, but Gakrun bested him in battle and ripped his arms off, humiliating him and winning the tribe over. Katz initially shot him without hesitation, but after speaking with him, he turned out to be an ally to us, because he was Gakruns enemy. We agreed to help him defeat Gakrun, if he agreed to keep the Goblins chill and not attack people. He agreed, and as it turns out, Hob Goblins are very honorable creatures, and rarely deviate from their word.
</p>
<p>
Once we enter the camp, we immediatly engage into combat with Gakrun and swiftly defeat him and his forces. This wins the army back to Creed allegiance, and he thanks us for our help and we leave. Before leaving, he says he'll probably turn this town into some sort of Goblinoid haven/town, and he also punches Katz for shooting him. We head back to Baticul to do a mission report, and we also have several applicants to our guild we wished to hire.
</p>
<p>
Our secretary, Janice, said we had 20 applications turned in, and we did 7 callbacks, and had enough funds to hire 6 employees for us. We ended up interviewing Rainstepper, Phil, Morlos, Braun, Forge, Ristal, and Vola. Vola was the one we did not hire. Everyone else we used to form several squads. Phil is an artificer, who is to make potions and enchantments for us, to either support us on missions or to sell through the guild. Ristal is a Drow rogue who mostly exists to do solo informational  missions. The rest we have put together in a single party to do side missions for us.
