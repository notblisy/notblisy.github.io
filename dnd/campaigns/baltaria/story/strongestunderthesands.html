<h2>The story so far...</h2>

<p>
After finishing our investigation of the green dragon incident we head back to our guild hall. In the hall we find Ristal, who we had previously sent out to find information on Tyrg and on Regan, to which we are told Regan has been sighted just about everywhere, and Tyrg supposedly left for Loxodon country. The B team comes back from defeating the a hydra in the swamp and we all enter the strongest under the sands tournament. </p>
<p>
Glanzend uses dominate person on Braun, our teammate and previous champion, but then loses a close battle to Khulon in the next round.
</p>
<p>Katz barely scrapes by in her first fight against a monk, then her second find goes much smoother as she skirts around the battlefield until her opponent surrenders.
</p>
<p>Forebrand handily dispatched both of his foes with help from his shield guardian.
