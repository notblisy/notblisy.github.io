<h2>The story so far...</h2>
<p> After The Sanguine Knights defeat, we all took off on our separate ways for one month. At the end of the month we all celebrated in Nirva at the fish festival, and Glanzends + Forebrand helped fix the fireworks. 
</p>
<p>In addition, we as a group were invited to the grand opening of the Large Train and take its inagural ride. During the ride, Proffesor Grumbledeehump attempted to orchestrate a theft of a Jade Fish that was stored in the safe for transport.
</p>
<p>After setting up our guild hall, we have been contracted to assasinate Jerico Cade and Gakrun Breaks Goblin armies.
