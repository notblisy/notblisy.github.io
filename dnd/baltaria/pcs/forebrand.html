<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He is a young man of 19, hair down past his shoulders of solid blonde. Easily retaining a flexible figure with combat training. The conflict within himself sometimes escapes into a mood-swing of sorrow or anger, but on every other occasion, he is incredibly nonchalant and happy to be around people. Growing up, if Forebrand didn't have such a close and loving sister, it would be no surprise for her to end up incredibly distant from her family. Katz quickly became his most invested relationship and the thought of losing more family would never escape him as he clings to and protects Her. He trusts people who are kind to him without giving it too much thought. He has trouble thinking before acting and causing undesirable outcomes.</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Abandoned as a child and raised by the royalty of NÃ¯rva, Forebrands troubled past embodies itself in different emotions. As he is raised and understood what it meant to not know her own parents, he is conflicted by what good and evil might truly mean. As a teenager, he pursues an engagement in the military to further her knowledge of what 'good' might mean. With some good combat experience, loyalty and trust from the crown, he is destined to learn what the difference between good and evil really means, while also searching for his parents; not to know them, but only to know the reason for abandonment.</p>
<h2>Alignment and Motivation</h2>
<p>Alignment: Lawful Neutral. Only learning a small portion of what 'good' can mean and knowning abandonment, his morals may only make sense to himself, but cast a shadow from what was learned from the crown.
</p><p>
Motivation: Making friends and enjoying life for what it is, while always keeping a keen eye for where his parents may be.
