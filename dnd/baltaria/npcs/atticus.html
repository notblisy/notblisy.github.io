<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>It was a fairly big party the Herris' were throwing in celebration of the Summer solstice. Little Katz and Forebrand were wandering the gardens playing hide and seek through a small brush-maze, and in the midst of their play Katz bumped her head into Atticus, who was outside to relax and get away from the party. Katz freaked out, knowing Atticus's importance in the country, bowing and apologizing repeatedly. Atticus laughed and told her to calm down and just to keep her head high and watch where she was going. He pulled out a little candy from his pocket and gave it to young Forebrand and told the two to keep having fun, and continued on his way.

<h2>Player Character Interaction</h2>
<p>When the party had the opportunity to meet Atticus, they presented him with many different issues at hand, the most prominent of which was the Sanguine Knights return. Katz was sweating and nervous during her presentation, but Atticus, while clearly very concerned about the news, kept a calm demeanor and asked the party to attempt to collect the remaining shards of the soul destroyer while they figured a way to deal with the knight.
