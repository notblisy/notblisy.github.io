<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Hardy slammed the shard into the adamantine armor, expecting his dream to finally come true-- He, the person the powder kegs called insane and raving, would be the one to finally have discovered the way to create the warforged. As the shard bonded to the armor, he waited. But nothing happened. He turned to his foes, with disappointment in head, needing to fight his way out.
</p>



<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hardy is a human<br>
He does not have a body part replaced with some sort of technology, like the rest of his cult. However, he does have four added robotic arms like doctor octopus. <br>
He had been putting up an act for a long time about being an over the top villain, but in reality he was just kind of a regular guy playing up a character.<br>
Desperately wanted to re-create the war-forged, but failed and summoned the Sanguine Knight.</p>


</p>
<h2>Player Character Interaction</h2>
<p>Several occasions Hardy tried to do very dramatic and over the top speeches about his plans, but he kept getting shut-down in various ways by being ignored or cut off. On the final encounter with the party, he elected to skip even attempting the monologue, to enact his plan.</p>
