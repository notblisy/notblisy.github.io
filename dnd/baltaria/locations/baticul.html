<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The merchants district is a distinctly fun place in this town, as you really can't find as many trinkets and objects in one place like you can in Baticul. From a bonestore to a cookwares store, you can find anything from any culture here. Even someone to buy your Giants Cookbook. It's the melting pot of Baltaria.
