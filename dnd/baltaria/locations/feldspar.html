<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Empty and dusty, feldspar may seem like a sad place at first, but you'll soon upon entry learn that every single person in this town is full of life just trying to do their best in a rough situation. It's got much positive atmosphere, and even at its worst when no-one in the town could make any money because One-Eyed-Jack was preventing them from using the mine, everyone kept their chins-up.
