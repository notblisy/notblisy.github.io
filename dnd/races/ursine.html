<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Placeholder</p>





<h2>Lore</h2>
<p>The Ursine are ancient beings, some of the oldest in the world, predating most races of man. It's unclear as to how they came about, as they do not have a written history or language of their own, and all known about Ursine past is through stories from one Ursine to another, or written documentation from other peoples. 
</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Ursine range from 5 to 10ft. tall depending on subrace, and can be a variety of colors, from white to brown to black. Usually they are on the larger end, and are always bulky with both muscle and fat. There is no visual difference between males and females, including their voice, which is often a deep grumble. </p>
<h2>Ursine Names</h2>
<p>An Ursine has two names, a given name, and a familial name. They are then combined, and pronounced as one name, with the familial name being capitalized to indicate the split. The one who raises the child is which family name that child is given. Names are simple, often grunt sounding. 
</p>
<p><b>Example Names:</b> TerraBor, ShinTo, FeroSil, KorFar.</p>
<div id="note">
<p style="font-size:16px;"><b>Love no one but the Earth</b></p>
<p>
Ursine tend to be very solitary and cold towards most people, even other Ursine. While they are cordial and do not mean disrespect, it is just because they are solitary. They usually only meet if it is important, and even if they have Ursine spouses it is not uncommon for them to go years without seeing eachother. The one thing they are warm to, is the Earth. Ursine have a deep connection with Nature and value the land they live in above all else, and would do anything to protect it from harm.</p>
