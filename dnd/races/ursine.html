Ursine tend to be very solitary and cold towards most people, even other Ursine. While they are cordial and do not mean disrespect, it is just because they are solitary. They usually only meet if it is important, and even if they have Ursine spouses it is not uncommon for them to go years without seeing eachother. The one thing they are warm to, is the Earth. Ursine have a deep connection with Nature and value the land they live in above all else, and would do anything to protect it from harm.</p>
