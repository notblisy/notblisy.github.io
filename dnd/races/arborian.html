<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Placeholder</p>





<h2>Lore</h2>
<p>A Trees early life, the first 10 years or so, start as a sapling where they are semi-concious. During that decade they take in information from their surrounding, and are usually discovered through magical searching by a Druidic enclave, a clan of Wood Elves, or a tribe of Forest Gnomes. Upon being discovered, they are taken care of by the people who find them, and are guarded near 24/7 while being taught things about the world through spoken word. After the Tree awakens, it comes to grips with its reality and the world it inhabits, typically spending another 5-10 years reaching maturity and learning from the clan that found it. Once it has learned all it can, it leaves to wander the world, to find a place to root. 
</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Arborians are so similar looking to typical trees that it can be distinguish from their actual tree-family counterparts. They have two branches mid-trunk that are treated as arms, and their many roots have them walk across the ground like spiders. They have two eyes, no nose, and usually a fairly small mouth.  </p>
<h2>Arborian Names</h2>
<p>Arborians are usually named by whatever type of people find them, and their names are usually easily translated across any language. It's typically just the species of tree they are, and the place they are from, in the language of the race that found them. 
</p>
<p><b>Example Names:</b> Willow of Deadwood, Pine of Neverwinter.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;"><b>A Place to Root</b></p>
<p>
Arborians, if they want to live exceptionally long lives(past 1000 yrs.), must eventually take root somewhere in the world. This is the biggest decision of their lives, as once they take root they can never move again. Most Arborians entire lifes journey is wandering the world to find the perfect place. Many never do, though few choose to not root. Most return to the forest of their birth to root, because it is safe and the people who raised them are there. Once here they often grow to be massive and revered for their vast wisdom they gained during their travels by the people who live there.</p>
