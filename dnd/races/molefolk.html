<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We do not tolerate lies in this city, exclaimed Si-Hal-Ette. The king of the great city-state of Moleantis was not pleased. Before him sat two theives, begging for forgiveness, claiming their ways would change. The two had been harassing local shipments going from the city-state to its territories for weeks, and it became apparent through the Zone of Truth that their intentions were not going to change. "I may be forgiving, but I am not foolish or weak. I gave you a chance for truth, but you squandered it. Throw them away while they await their trial."
<br>
A spartanly people, most Mole-Folk value Truth, Strength, and their community above all else. While Moles often spend their days within their kingdom working to improve upon their craft, lives, and the lives of those around them, many recognize the only way to spread the prosperity and quality of life they have is to leave.</p>





<h2>Punished by a God</h2>
<p>Once the capital city of a large human majority empire that dominated the lands because of its location near magic ore mines, the city-state of Moleantis was forced underground and sealed magically from the outside worled, with its population turned into large humanoid moles by a divine power to restore balance to the world and punish the empire for its greed.
</p>
<p>
This caused a split in the residents, and those that believed the only way forward was to accept this punishment by worshiping the gods, rejecting the magics that caused such greed, and learning to live morally stayed in the city. There, however, were those that felt resentful of such a punishment and rejected such ideas. These people left the bounds of the city, looting and scrounging to survive.

</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Moles range from six to eight feet tall, with short fur that can be varying shades of brown to black. This color fades to grey or salt and pepper as they grow old. Male moles also tend to grow thin facial hair at the end of their snout.</p>
<h2>Mole-Folk Names</h2>
<p>Moles have three names, one given, one picked, and one family. Each name is only one syllable, and is divided by a dash. The first name is given by the parents, the middle is chosen by themselves once adulthood is reached, and the last is the family name. In formal situations, the full name is referenced, and the full name is always used when speaking to a Mole in a position of power over you, such as an elder relative, a superior at work, or the King. In casual situations just the first name is typically used, though some Moles to prefer their chosen name. Names are not gendered in any way.
</p>
<p><b>Example Names:</b> Va-Rha-Shall, Si-Hal-Ette, Ti-So-Rhan, Ki-Kor-Elle, San-Vi-Tahr, Kor-Ja-Ku, Ran-Jon-Si, Sho-Fu-Lore, Mo-U-To, Gah-En-Vi, Il-Er-Shu, Mur-Dra-Fell.</p>
<div id="note">
<p style="font-size:16px;"><b>Friends to all, but their enemies.</b></p>
<p>
Moles are the type of folk who trust first, but are insanely dangerous to cross. Because they once were humans, and share a similar lifespan and perspective, they get along with almost all races easily. Except any of the dark under races such as<b> Drow, Duergar, and Svirfneblin</b>, because these are the ones that are most likely to cause trouble in their city which often resides near the under.</p>

<br><b><i>Subrace.</i></b> Two subraces of Mole exist, based on the dynamic of the city-state. Choose from one of these subraces:

<p>
Raised in Moleantis, or a territory of the city-state, a Citizen has served their time in the military, and shares many of the values of Truth, Strength, and practicality.
