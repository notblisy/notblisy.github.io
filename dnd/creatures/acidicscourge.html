<div class="attack"><span class="attackname">Abberant Ground.</span><span class="description"> The ground in a 10-foot radius around the scourge is thick, mud-like difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength check, or have its speed reduced to 0 until its next turn.</span></div>    
<div class="attack"><span class="attackname">Radioactive Form.</span><span class="description"> The scourge can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creatures space ona  turn, that creature(s) must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saing throw or suffer a radioactive deformity. Roll a d4 to decide which effect the creature is afflicted with. The deformity takes effect at the start of the creatures next turn and a creature can't have two deformities at once. <br> 1.)Neck Growth - The creature grows a giant, puss-filled growth around the size of a football on the back of its neck. The huge growth is connected to the creatures brain and causes the creature harm when it takes damage which effectively lowers the creatures AC By 4. The growth has 30 hit points and causes its host to take any damage it receives. If the growth is subjected to bludgeoning, peircing, or slashing damage, it causes its host to take double that amount of damage up to 60. Once the growth takes 30 damage, it ruptures and the creature returns to normal. The growth lasts 1 minute.<br> 2.)Restless Arm - The creature grows a humanoid-like arm from their back and they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of their turns while the arm is attached. On a failed throw, the arm acts on its own midlessly. The arm can attack its host, use the hosts items, disarm the host of a weapon or shield, attack nearby creatures or interact with nearby objects. The arm is controlled by the DM on a failed throw. Successful throws cause the creature to control the arm as if it were their own. The arm has 25 hit points, 5 ft range on all actions and an attack that deals 2d10 + the host modifier in bludgeoning damage. When the arm is reduced to 0 hit points, the arm is severed and the host returns to normal. When the arm is subjected to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, the host takes double damage recueved up to 50. The arm lasts 1 minute.<br> 3.)Festergut - The creature is afflicted with a plague that causes their organs to become dangerously enflamed forcing the creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turns. On failed throws, the creature spends its turn retching on the ground and becomes prone. Additionally, the creature takes 11 (2d10) acid damage when it fails a throw. Successful throws cause the creature to act and move normally. If the creature fails 3 throws in a row, they are subjected to the exhaustion level 1. Each next fail in a row also causes the exhaustion level to further by one. The plague lasts 30 seconds. <br>4.)The Third Eye - Instead of a gross deformity, the creature grows a powerful third eye in the center of its forehead, granting them truesight of 60 ft. Roll initiative for the eye for its own turns. The eye acts on its own and sees no one as an ally. The eye is aware that if the host dies, it is released to the ethereal plane freely, but if the host takes damage, the eye feels pain. The eye only knows sorcerer evocation spells up to 3rd level and can only cast them at the lowest level without needing V, S, or M. It also doesn't use spellslots and lasts 1 minute attached to the host. </span></div> 
<div class="attack"><span class="attackname">The ultimate Corrosion.</span><span class="description"> A creature that touches or hits the scourge within 5 ft takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the scourge corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -2 penalty to damage rolls. If the penalty drops to -6, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the scourge is destroyed after dealing damage. The scourge can eat through 4-inch metal or wood in one round. If the scourge hits a creature wearing nonmagical armor or a shield, that items is partially dissolved and takes a permanent cumulative -2 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduced its AC to 10. </span></div>

Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed throw, creatures take 50 (9d10) acid damage and have their movement halved on their next turn. Successful throws causes creatures to take half the damage and their movement is unaffected. Any creature that took damage from the spray is affected by The Ultimate Corrosion on even a successful throw.</span></div>
