<h4>Homebrew class by <a href="https://twitter.com/im_a_blisy">Blisy</a>. This is a WIP.<a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/zwNOiQbLAYaN"> Homebrewery / PHB PDF Link here!</a></h4>

<p>A Drow in studded leather lays quiet on the edge of the battlefield, watching, waiting, listening, for any opening the enemy might give her. There it is, the snap of a twig, a brief look of confusion, and then the perfect shot rings through the air dead on.</p>
<p>A Human at his last stand against an imposing Gnoll, realizes he's only got one shot left. In hopes of distracting the creature, he twirls his gun about before firing, missing completely. As his last ditch effort, he then cloppers the Gnoll on the head with the butt of his gun, before making a quick escape.</p>
<p>Breathing calmly in the midst of battle, a Gnome slowly loads a round into her chamber, and fires at the leader of a small group of bandits. The bullet collides, and in a swift inferno, the bullet explodes into the spell Fire Ball and tears their camp and raiding equipment asunder.</p>
<p>All of these heroes are Marksman. The premier Firearms expert in Dungeons and Dragons. This is the class to look for if you're aiming to play a rowdy gunslingin' cowboy, a careful calculated sniper, or fusion of modern technology with magic.</p>


<h2>Tools for the job</h2>
Marksman are exceptional at assesing their current situation, and using what they have available to think on their feet and deal the most damage they can to their targets while minimizing it to themselves.

<div id="header4"><b>Firearm Properties</b></div>

<b><i>Loading.</i></b> Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of Ammunition from it when you use an action, Bonus Action, or Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
<br>
<b><i>Ammunition.</i></b> You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged Attack only if you have Ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you Attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of Ammunition. Drawing the Ammunition from a Quiver, case, or other container is part of the Attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee Attack, you treat the weapon as an Improvised Weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. All Firearms use the same type of ammunition. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Ammunition</b></div>
All Firearms use ammunition, just like a bow does. There are a few things to keep in mind about this-- 
 <ol>
  <li>Missed shots can not be recovered.</li>
  <li>Ammo can be crafted using your gunsmiths toolkit.</li>
  <li>Ammos cost is 3g for 20 rounds at stores.</li>
</ol> 

<b><i>Ammunition Crafting.</i></b> To craft ammunition, you must roll a skill check on your Gunsmiths Tool kit, spend 3g worth of gold as if you had used 3g worth of supplies, and the results are as follows: 
<ul>
<li><b>1-4</b> On a 1-5 roll, you create 1/2 of the ammo you could purchase for 3g. <b>(10 ammo for 3g.)</b></li>
<li><b>6-9</b> On a 6-9 roll, you create 3/4 of the ammo you could purchase for 3g. <b>(15 ammo for 3g.)</b></li>
<li><b>10-14</b> On a 10-14, you create the amount of ammo you normally could purchase for 3g. <b>(20 ammo for 3g.)</b></li>
<li><b>15-19</b> On a 15-19, you create 50% more ammo than you normally could purchase for 3g. <b>(30 ammo for 3g.)</b></li>
<li><b>20+</b> On a 20+, you create 100% more ammo than you normally could purchase for 3g. <b>(40 ammo for 3g.)</b></li>
</ul>

These are special augments you can purchase for your Firearms to enhance them in unique or interesting ways. Above are the acceptable augmentations for your Firearms and their properties. Below are descriptions of how they will function. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Bayonet.</i></b> You may attach a Bayonette to your Firearm to give you an easier way to deal with melee combat situations. It's a simple d6 Piercing weapon on the end of your Firearms.
<br>
<b><i><a name="spray">Spray.</a></i></b> A Spray augment allows your Firearm of choice to, instead of making an attack roll, choose a 10ft. Cube within normal firing range and make all creatures within make a Dexterity saving throw of 8+Your Dexterity+Your Proficiency. All creatures that fail take the weapons full damage die, and all that fail take half. This costs 10 Ammunition.

<h2>Building a Marksman</h2>
The main thing to consider is are guns in this world, and why would your character take an interest in them? Often times guns are not in standard D&D worlds, so be sure to make sure they are available to you. It's also important to note, that while they are versatile in regards to what they can do with their weapons, Marksman can use almost nothing besides their pistols or rifles in any given situation. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Quick Build</b></div>
You can make a Marksman quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest score, followed by Intelligence. Though depending on your subclass, it may be best to do Intelligence as your highest, followed by Dexterity. Finally, take the Folk hero, Pirate, or Sailor backgrounds.

<h2>Class Features</h2>
<div id="header4"><b>Hit Points</b></div>
<b><i>Hit Dice.</i></b> 1d8 Per Marksman Level.
<br>
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8+ your Constitution Modifier.

<br>
<b><i>Saving Throws.</i></b> Dexterity, Intelligence.

<b><i>Skills.</i></b> Choose two from: Sleight of hand, Stealth, History, Investigation, Arcana, Insight, Perception, Intimidation
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Equipment</b></div>
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
<ul>
<li>Leather Armor</li>
<li>(a)Heavy Pistol or (b) Two Palm Pistols</li>
<li>(a)Bayonet (b)Shield (c) Cutlass</li>
<li>Gunsmiths toolkit</li>
<li>30 rounds of ammunition</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="quickdraw">Quickdraw</a></h2>
Starting at the 1st level, once per day you can take the attack action at the start of initiative.
<h2><a name="fightingstyle">Fighting Style</a></h2>
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Deadeye</b></div>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged firearm weapons.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Blind Fighter</b></div>
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. 
<br>
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Riot Control</b></div>
When you are wielding a Firearm in one hand and a shield on another hand, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls and you may reload your firearm without a free hand.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>The Double</b></div>
Light Firearms now count as a valid weapon for two weapon fighting, you may reload your firearm without a free hand, and you may add your proficiency bonus to off hand attacks. 
<h2>Marksman Archetype</h2>
At the 3rd level, you choose from one of the three types of Marksman Archetypes. 
<ul>
<li><a href="#gunslinger">Gunslinger</a></li>
<li><a href="#sniper">Sniper</a></li>
<li><a href="#gunmage">Gun Mage</a></li>
<li><a href="#monksman">Monksman</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="asi">Ability Score Improvement</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgoe taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="fastreload">Fast Reload</a></h2>
Starting at the 5th level, you ignore the loading trait on any Firearm that has it.

<h2><a name="extraattack">Extra Attack</a></h2>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<br>
The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

<h2><a name="alternateammunition">Alternate Ammunition</a></h2>
Starting at the 9th level, you modify your gun to take the following alternate forms of ammunition: Explosive, Piercing, Smoke, or Buck. This special ammunition is hand crafted by you and cannot be bought, and you only have time to make four rounds per day. The rounds you have expire 24 hours after you make them because of how tempermental they are. In addition, each Marksman Archetype has a unique effect with one of the Ammunition types. 
<br>
<br>
Starting at the 17th level, you can craft 12 alternate rounds per day instead of 4.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Explosive.</i></b> Explosive rounds deal an extra 1d10 on Collision with a target in a 10ft Radius centered on the target.
<br>
<b><i>Gunslinger: Rocket Jump.</i></b>  Gunslingers may use Explosive ammunition for Mobility. If you are within 5ft. of the target you're shooting, you are forced 10ft. plus a number of ft. rolled on the 1d10 damage die that the Explosive round uses. This does not provoke attack of opportunity or use any of your normal movement.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Piercing.</i></b> When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can attempt to fire through multiple opponents. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and you make an attack roll with disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the target within your first range increment. 
<br>
<b><i>Sniper: Pinpoint Precision.</i></b> If the Sniper is using a piercing round, you no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls made to the subsequent targets.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Buck.</i></b> This ammunition deals bludgeoning type damage, and deals an extra 1d8 and it deals half damage on a miss instead of 0 damage. 
<br>
<b><i>Gun Mage: Magical Barrel.</i></b> The Gun Mage may enchant their buckshot ammunition. Because Buckshot explodes immediatly as it leaves the barrel of your firearm, the source of your spell becomes the barrel of your firearm as opposed to the impact of the shot.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Smoke.</i></b> This ammunition causes a 20ft. radius smoke cloud to appear centered on the target you hit. This area is considered heavily obscured and lasts one minute. 
<br>
<b><i>Monksman: Sight Beyond Sight.</i></b> The Monksman does not suffer blindness or any perception penalties within the smoke cloud, because of their heightened awareness.
<br>
<h2><a name="hoplophobia">Hoplophobia</a></h2>
Beggining at the 13th level, when making an Intimidation check using your Firearm, instead of rolling a d20, you may choose to have a 15+Charisma+Dexterity as your roll for that check istead. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header5"><b>Marksman Archetypes</b></div>
<h2><a name="gunslinger">Gunslinger</a></h2>
Charismatic, charming, and not afraid to get up close and personal, the Gunslinger uses their wits and quick reflexes to outsmart and out manuever their opponents in a fight.
<br>
<b>Grit.</b> When you choose this archetype at the 3rd level, you gain 4 Grit Die, and you gain an additional die at levels 7, 10, and 15. Your Grit die are d4s, and increase to d6s at the 10th level, and again to d8s at the 18th level. You regain all expended grit die on a long or short rest. On top of this, getting a critical hit restores 1 grit die. Whenever you roll your Grit Die, you add your Intelligence modifier to it. 
<br>
<b>Trick Shots.</b>
Upon choosing this archetype, you gain access to several trick shots to choose from. You use these trick shots by spending Grit. Choose 3 trick shots at level 3, and you gain an additional trick shot at the 7th, 10th, 13th, 15th, and 18th levels. 
<br>
<b>Saving Throws.</b> Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<br>
<b>Trick Shot save DC</b> = 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.
<b>Saving Throws.</b> 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Close Quarters Shooter</b></div>
At the 3rd level, when making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 10 feet of you.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="fightindirty">Fightin' Dirty</a></b></div>
Starting at the 7th level, when you take the disengage action on your turn, you may make an Melee weapon attack with one of your Firearms. You use your Dexterity Modifier for attack and damage rolls, and is has a d8 as its weapon die.

<div id="header4"><b><a name="theduel">The Duel</a></b></div>
Starting at the 10th Level, on your turn, if you and an enemy are the only creatures within 10 ft of eachother, you may initiate a duel(this is a free action). 
<br>
<br>
The enemy must make a charisma saving throw following your DC for trick shots. If they fail, you two are <b>engaged in a duel.</b>
<br>
<br>
Both you and your target roll a Dexterity Check. The one with the Higher Roll is <b>The Winner</b>. The one with the lower roll is <b>The Loser</b>
<br>
<br>
After the Dexterity check, <b>The Winner</b> makes an attack roll and deals 1 extra damage die if the attack connects.
<br>
<br>
Then, <b>The Loser</b> makes an attack roll with disadvantage.

After the attack rolls are made, <b>The Loser</b> may no longer take any attack actions on their next turn. <b>The Winner</b> takes their turn as usual. 
<br>
<br>
You regain the use of this ability after a short rest or long rest.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="cutloose">Cut Loose</a></b></div>
Starting at the 15th level, you may on your attack action, choose to spend up to 5 grit points to increase the lethality of your shot. For each grit point spent, you deal an additional weapon die of damage.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="unwaveringgrit">Unwavering Grit</a></b></div>
Starting at the 18th level, creatures have disadvantage when trying to intimidate you, and if you have no grit at the start of combat, you gain grit equal to half your int modifier. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Trick Shots</b></div>
The Trick Shots are presented in alphabetical order.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bullying Shot.</b> You can use the powerful blast and thundering sound of your firearm to shake the resolve of a creature. You may spend one grit die while making a Charisma (Intimidation) check to gain advantage on the roll. In addition, you may add the roll of the Grit die to the Intimidation roll.
<br>
<br>
<b>Curved Shot.</b> You may spend one grit die to attempt to curve your shot around creatue you can see. The shot can only curve once, and can only curve horizontally, and on a hit, you may add the result of the grit die to the damage.
<br>
<br>
<b>Disarming Shot.</b> When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can spend one grit die to attempt to shoot an object from their hands. On a hit, you may add the roll of the grit die to the damage, and they must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one held object of your choice and have that object be pushed 10 feet away from you. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Frightening Shot.</b> As you Fire your weapon, you spend one grit die to attempt to instill fear within the enemy through your ferocity in combat. On a hit, you add the grit die roll to your damage, and the creature hit must makes a Charisma saving throw or become Frightened of you until the end of your next turn. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Goading Shot.</b> You spend one grit die and make some rude remarks to attempt to Goad a creature. When hit by your attack, you may add the roll of the grit die to your damage, and they must make an Intelligence saving throw, and if they fail, they have disadvantage on attack rolls on attacks rolls on anyone but until the end of your next turn.
<br>
<br>
<b>Precision Shot.</b> When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one grit die to add it to the roll. You can use this trick shot before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
<br>
<br>
<b>Raise Morale.</b> You spend your attack action and one grit die and instead of making an attack roll on an enemy, you shoot your bullet straight into the air and give a rousing speech. All allies within 20 feet of you may move 10 feet without opportunity attack and can roll your grit die with their next attack roll to add it to their total. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Ranged Parry.</b> When an enemy makes a non-magical ranged attack roll on you or an ally, you may spend one grit die and your reaction to attempt to shoot the target out of the air. You enter into a contest with the attack roll made by the enemy, and you add your grit die roll to your attack roll. If you tie or beat their attack roll, you knock the projectile out of their air nullifying that attacks damage. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Ricocheting Shot.</b> You may spend one grit die when you make an attack roll, and if your attack hits you add the grit die roll as additional damage, and it Ricochets off its target and an adjacent creature you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take the same damage your initial target took. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Riposte.</b> When a creature within Melee range misses an attack, you can use your reaction and spend one grit die to make a ranged attack roll on that creature. If you hit, roll the grit die along with your damage die.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tricky Shot.</b> You spend one grit die to make a slight of hand check, and add the grit die roll to it, if you beat a 10 DC, you flip your gun around stylishly and distractingly to gain advantage on your attack roll. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Tripping Shot.</b> You spend one grit die while making an attack roll to attempt to trip an opponent up. They take your grit die as additional damage, and must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they are knocked prone.

<h2><a name="sniper">Sniper</a></h2>
The Snipers Focus is long distance and precision. These disciplined Marksman skirt along the edge of a battlefield attempting to hide from sight and deal as much damage as possible -- But be weary, they lack strength up close.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Take Aim</b></div>
At the 3rd level, you may use a bonus actuon to <b>Take Aim</b> at your opponent. Your next attack against that target adds your Intelligence modifier to hit and damage as you pinpoint a targets weakpoint. In addition, 19 and 20 are both considered <b>Critical Hits.</b> This feature may be used a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier + 3 and recharges all uses on a short or long rest.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Heavy Artillery</b></div>
At the 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Firearms marked with the <b><i>Heavy</b></i> weight tag.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="lowprofile">Low Profile</a></b></div>
Starting at the 7th level, ranged Firearm attacks do not suffer disadvantage while you are lying prone. Lying prone counts as being in 1/2 cover for you, and standing up from prone only costs 5ft. of movement.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="expertsniper">Expert Sniper</a></b></div>
At the 10th level attacks on enemies that are more than 30ft. away ignore 1/2 and 3/4 cover. You also no longer suffer disadvantage because of long range.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="hemorragingshots">Hemorraging Shots</a></b></div>
Starting at the 15th level, your attacks, with their precision, now cause targets to bleed the damage of the attack roll at the end of every one of their turns for 4 rounds or until they are stabilized with a heal or a medicine check. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="eagleeye">Eagle Eye</a></b></div>
Starting at the 18th level, you may choose to roll a 20 on a perception check to find an enemy. Recharge on short or long rest. You also have advantage on all perception checks.
<h2><a name="gunmage">Gun Mage</a></h2>
Combining modern firearm technology with ancient magical knowledge, you carve runes into your gun and bullets as part of preparing your spells. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Spellbook</b></div>
At the 3rd level, you have a spellbook containing 6 1st-level Gun Mage spells of your choice. Your spellbook contains the repository of Gun Mage spells you know, except cantrips which you have fixed in memory. 
<br>
<b><i>Gaining New Spells.</b></i> You gain 2 spells every time you level up for free to add to your Spellbook. Additionaly, you may find spells through adventuring, such as purchasing a scroll from a shop, or finding old Wizards notes in an ancient library. Spells found this way must be of a Spell Level that you can cast, or you cannot add it to your spellbook. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Spellcasting</b></div>
When you reach the 3rd level, you augment your Marksman prowess with the ability to cast spells through your firearm. See chapter 11 for the Gun Mage spell list.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Focus.</b></i>  You choose your focus by carving a 1st level spell of choice into your Firearm. This firearm then becomes your focus, and the mechanism through which you cast spells. You may have more than one focus.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Cantrips.</b></i> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at the 10th level.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</b></i> Dexterity and Intelligence are your spellcasting modifiers for your spell attacks, since you learn spells through study and memorization, but Fire them through your firearm. Any time a spells to hit is tied to if a bullet hits, you use Dexterity, otherwise you use Intelligence. In addition, you use your intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Gun Mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with a weapon that is charged with a spell. See more in <b><i>A New Way to Cast Spells.</b></i>
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>A New Way to Prepare Spells</b></div>
To prepare a spell, you must have it in your spellbook. There are two ways to prepare a spell. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Gun Glyphs.</b></i> You may choose to carve up to 3 spells onto your Firearm. This prepares a spell permanently as long as you are casting from that firearm. You may not remove a spell carving from a Firearm in any way. Multiple guns may have spells carved into them. Regular ammunition can be used to cast spells this way. Consider these your main spells, and choose them wisely.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Rune Bullets.</b></i> Alternatively, you may carve spell runes into your bullets. This requires a regular round of ammunition, and 1 minute to copy a spell from your book onto the bullet. The number of spells you may carve per day is equal to your Intelligence Modifier + Your Marksman level. The spell must also be of a spell level you can cast. This consumes the regular round of ammunition, but replaces it with a <b><i>Rune Bullet.</i></b> This does two things to the bullet: 
<ol>
<li>It makes the bullet a magical weapon for resitance purposes, even when not used to cast a spell.</li>
<li>It now contains the essence of a spell within it. Now, when you fire a rune bullet from your firearm, you may consume a spell slot to empower the rune on the bullet with the spell inscribed on it. When shot, hit or miss, this specific bullet is unable to be used again. This means you can have a finite amount of specific prepared spells. </li>
</ol>
The Gun Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher, and how many cantrips you know. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>A New Way to Cast Spells</b></div>
You cannot cast any spells naturally, only through a firearm attack. This still counts as a <b><i>Cast a Spell Action</i></b>, though. This means you may not use the extra attack feature when firing a spell from your firearm. Your spells only activate upon bullets colliding with a target. Standard spellcasting rules apply, this means you may only cast one 1st level spell and 1 cantrip on a turn, regardless of how many attacks you make per turn. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Range.</b></i> The initial spells range is the range of your firearm attack. If the spell says it travels, IE Fireball, it doesn't. The only exception to this is spells that spawn more than one projectile, IE Magic Missile. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Spell Attacks.</b></i> For spells that are ranged or melee spell attacks, you use Dex+Proficiency to hit for the Ranged Weapon Attack, and if the spell spawns multiple projectiles on hit, you use Int+Proficiency to hit for those. If the bullet collides with the target, the spell activates as intended and you deal both your Firearm Weapon damage, AND the spells damage. If the spell attack can hit multiple targets, then the only the first hit of the spell is guaranteed to hit along with the bullet, then you must choose targets for the remaining spell attacks to hit, and roll to hit for those separately. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Example.</b></i> You cast Scorching Ray as a second level spell as your first attack action. You roll an 18+Dex, and it hits. You deal 1d8+Dex Weapon Die damage, then the 2d6 fire damage from One Scorching Ray. After that, the two other Scorching rays fly off and you choose two more targets, rolling to hit using your Intelligence Modifier.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Saving Throw Spells.</b></i> Your saving throw DC is 8+Intelligence+Proficiency. The way these spells work is that if the bullet collides with a target, then the spell activates and if saving throws are required, they are then made. <b><i>If it is an area of effect spell, the point / face nearest to its collision is its origin point, and line spells start at said target and continue in a line behind that target at the angle they were shot from. This means you can miss saving throw spells and waste those spell slots.</i></b> You may shoot inanimate objects or allies if need be to start the area of effect.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Example.</b></i> You cast Shatter as a 2nd level spell. Your attack roll is an 18+6, and you hit. You deal 1d8+Dex damage, then your shatter spell explodes out at the point of impact. The creatures within range, including the one you hit with the attack, must attempt the saving throw for Shatter. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Non-Damaging Spells.</b></i>  Casting spells that deal no damage work as described above. If you wish to cast a targeted spell, you must first hit the target with an attack roll, and then said target make must the required saving throws / if there is none the spell effect is applied. If it is an area of effect spell, the point / face nearest to its collision is its origin point.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Other Cases.</b></i>  If a spell takes longer or less time than 1 action to cast, you may not cast it. You may also not cast spells as a ritual. Reaction spells may not be cast. Concentration works as normal. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Spells Learned from Other Sources.</b></i> Spells learned from Multiclassing, feats, racial, or any non Gun Mage source may be cast normally without your Firearm. These spells learned from outside of this class may only be from your Firearm if they are written into your spellbook, and your spells from this class may not be cast through means other than your Firearm.

<div id="header4"><b>Bonded Gun</b></div>
At the 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one Firearm. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The Firearm must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the Firearm and forge the bond.
<p>Once you have bonded a Firearm to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that Firearm unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
</p><p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
</p>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="arcaneshots">Arcane Shots</a></b></div>
Starting at the 7th level, when firing a bullet from your focus, you may choose to use your Intelligence on attack and damage rolls even if it’s not a spell. 
<br>
<br>
Additionally, you may alter the damage type of the bullet, regardless of its ammunition type. Choose from the following options.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Cold.</i></b>
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Fire.</i></b>
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Force.</i></b>

<div id="header4"><b><a name="arcanestrike">Arcane Strike</a></b></div>
At the 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="teleportingshots">Teleporting Shots</a></b></div>
At the 15th level your bullets now teleport from the barrel upon fire, and may directly impact enemies instead of worrying about allys or objects being in the way-- As long as you can see the target, you can shoot them.
 <br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b><a name="arcanegun">Arcane Gun</a></b></div>
Starting at 18th level, your gun now no longer needs ammo, and generates an infinite supply of magical bullets on attack. These shots may only be imbued with spells carved directly onto the gun itself, however.

Roll 1d12 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier and you reduce the damage by this amount. If you reduce the damage to 0 you may make a shove attack in retaliation. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>During your turn, instead of one of your normal attacks, you may instead choose to do a Whirlwind strike. You spin around rapidly in a fury of gunfire, punches, and kicks. All creatures within a 10ft. radius centered on you must make a Dexterity saving throw. The saving throw formula is <b><i>8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</b></i>. If they fail, they take your ranged weapon die + intelligence as damage. On a success they take half as much damage. </li>
</ul>

Starting at the 15th level, your melee firearm attacks count as magical damage for the purpose of resistance calculation.
<br>
<br>
In addition, once per short rest you may harness your martial arts training to increase the lethality of your Firearm attacks. On each turn for the next minute, your first attack each turn will do its maximum potential damage.

Starting at the 18th level, once per long rest you can take up to 5 additional actions on your turn. After your turn ends, you make take no actions the following turn, and increase your exhaustion level by however many extra actions you took this turn. For example, if you took 4 actions this turn, you would increase your exhaustion by 3, because your first action is your standard action.

<div id="header4"><b>Properties</b></div>
<b><i>Flare.</i></b> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Spray.</i></b> This weapon can only fire as if it was using the Spray Augment, and cannot attack normally. <a href="#spray">See Spray Augment for details</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Special.</i></b> Special. Special means the weapon has a unique ammunition type, and maybe some special additional propertiest that will be explained in the weapons description. 
<br>
<br>
<div id="header4"><b>Variant Firearm Descriptions</b></div>
<b><i>Grappling Hook.</i></b>The grappling hook is a utilitarian weapon both in and out of combat. In combat, it it can serve as a ranged grapple. Your roll to hit is contested by a creatures Acrobatics or Athletics to escape. If they fail, they are successfully grappled and may attempt to escape on subsequent turns, at a flat DC 14. In addition, the creature may be moved by pulling on the rope. To do this, you must succeed in an Athletics contest vs the creature. 
<br>
Out of combat the Grappling Hook may be used to get rope easily across gaps or onto buildings. How this is done is up to the DM.
<br>
You may tie as much rope as you want to the end of the Hook itself, even if it's much more rope than the weapons range. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Net Gun.</i></b> The net gun allows you to fire the Net ranged weapon a great distance. Here are the properties of a standard net: 
<br>
A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is Restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Scattergun.</i></b> The scattergun releases powerful concussive blasts as it fires into a target area, and only uses Spray type firing style. In addition, all creatures of small size or lower are always knocked 5ft. away from you. Creatures of a medium or large size must make a Strength saving throw, or be knocked 5ft away. DC 15.
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Mass Inverter.</i></b> Upon hit with a target, the mass inverter deals a small amount of Psychic damage, but the Target is levitated 40ft. into the air, to take 4d6 bludgeoning damage as they fall back down, landing prone unless they avoid the damage. They stay airborn until the start of your next turn. You may not make another attack until the first target has fallen. 
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Peace Maker.</i></b> Upon a hit with a target, the Peace Maker arcs to all creatures within 10 ft. All creatures within 10ft must make a Dexterity saving throw DC 16, and if they fail, they are afflicted by the same damage as the original target. No damage on a success.
