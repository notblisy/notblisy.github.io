<p>A white tabaxi with a white mane, one of the four oligarchs who rule baltaria. He is wielder of a spear known as skyes edge.

</p>


<h2>Player Character Interaction</h2>
<p>We met Whitemane as he was visiting sunstone after its attack at the hands of the Sanguine Knight. He provided us with information regarding the location of a shard. We were under the impression that the Knight had already found it, but he had not. Whitemane said that no traps had been set in the tomb where it lay, so the party headed that way.
