<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Long ago, after the four great weapons were forged, supposedly someone forged a weapon of equal power, to do as much evil as a balance to the good the four weapons could create. No one knows who forged it, or how it got into the Knights hands, but once it was, chaos and bloodshed was sewn across the land. Many hid in fear of this unstoppable force, but even more fearful, they gathered an astronomical following of soldiers behind them as well to help in the destruction.  Eventually, the knight was stopped, and its sword broken into five shards, but none know how or when, and none are even sure if the tales are true.


</p>



<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The sanguine knight is an ancient being who once wielded the soul destroyer.<br>
Thought to have been long dead, Hardy resurrected them unknowingly by placing a shard in some adamantine armor.<br>
They haven't done much since being awakened, but they are definitely powerful and looking for the pieces of the soul destroyer.<br>
Aliases: Blood Rain</p>

<h2>Player Character Interaction</h2>
<p>Spawned by Hardy and the cult of the iron gear in the clocktower of feldspar by placing a shard inside adamantine armor, the Sanguine Knight swiftly knocked out Brother Neiro and threw Hardy out a window, asked where its sword was, and walked outside to not be seen anytime soon.
