<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Alliance of Baltaria, or simply Baltaria, is the country / continent the game currently takes place upon. Long ago, it was once four larger factions, and several dozen smaller ones, and consistent in conflict with eachother. Until, one day, an alliance was formed through four great peace keeping weapons. Each leader of one of the four main factions received a weapon, and it represented equal power across all four factions. These four leaders would consistently pass their leadership rights down through the ages via either offspring or abdicating power to trusted associates to keep the peace for thousands of years. The player party currently is working for them attempting to stop the Sanguine Knight, and the ruiners, who posses a weapon as powerful as the ones each leader posses, from destroying the peace and people of this land.
