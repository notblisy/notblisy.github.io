<h2>Description</h2>
<p>House Orien is a family of beings seemingly chosen at random by some extra-planar/terrestrial force, it gives them various movement abilities and marks them somewhere on their being.</p>

<p>The known abilities received are teleportation magics/skills. Regan and Forebrand are the only known actual descendants of House Orien still alive. Regan attempted to coax Forebrand into working with her, but her motivations were against his own adoptive family.</p>

<p>House Orion is a faction of people who used to rule Nirva a little more than 100 years ago, who were overthrown by Zinnea and Ludan Herris and Atticus for worshiping a being known as Fulmuhault the Autumn star. This being was an immensely powerful diety who the clan wished to call to our planet / plane. After they were killed and drove out of the city, Regan became the sole member left after those 100 years.</p>

<p>Now Regan, the sole member of the family gathered together various misfits from other races who seemed to be outcasts. She took them under her wing and was kind to them, and in so received their allegiance and assistance. Their goals are three-fold right now. To summon the Autumn star, kill the Herris family and reclaim Nirva, and find more members of House Orien, if they exist besides Regan and Forebrand.</p>
